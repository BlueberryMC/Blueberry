# Blueberry

Open-source modding API for Minecraft

## Why?
- Faster update (since it uses mojang mapping, no need to make our mapping)
- Deobfuscated code (classes, fields, methods)

## Important Warning
**Blueberry is a very small project.**
Whilst I try not to break API compatibility, but things could change at anytime!

## Known Issues
- Cannot stop debug profiler using `/debug stop` after using `/debug start`
- Can't join using BungeeCord/Waterfall? (needs testing)

## Todo
- multiplayer support
  - "deny" incompatible clients, it just shows "incompatible" in client/server menu and users can connect

## Links
- [Changelogs](https://cl-b.acrylicstyle.xyz/)
