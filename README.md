# Blueberry

Open-source modding API for Minecraft

## Why?
- Faster update (since it uses mojang mapping, no need to make our mapping)
- Deobfuscated code (classes, fields, methods)

## Important Warning
**Blueberry is a very small project.**
Whilst I try not to break API compatibility, but things could change at anytime!

## Known Issues

## Todo
- Provide easy way to create profile or version in launcher for Blueberry
  - probably with bsdiff
- multiplayer support
