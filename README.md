# Blueberry

Open-source modding API for Minecraft

## Important Warning
**Blueberry is a very small project.**
While I try to make this project bigger, there's literally almost no API for now.
It takes a long time to make this project bigger and get good APIs.

assets/blueberry/textures/gui/icons.png is from FML, obviously. (thanks FML, MinecraftForge team)

## Todo
- Provide easy way to create profile or version in launcher for Blueberry
  - probably with bsdiff
- multiplayer support
