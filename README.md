# Blueberry

Open-source modding API for Minecraft

## About this branch

This branch (`feature/api`) aims to provide a stable API between the Minecraft versions. In this branch, Blueberry-API
module does **NOT** include magmacube in classpath, which means we are not able to use Minecraft classes in
Blueberry-API module, so I'm trying to implement the API and use Minecraft classes in Blueberry-API-Impl module.
Also, this branch is based on `dev/1.19` branch. Adventure API will (probably) be implemented in this branch.

## ü§î Why?
- Faster update (since it uses mojang mapping, no need to make our mapping)
  - it does not mean "fast update", because sometimes i don't have enough time to work on this project :(
- Deobfuscated code (classes, fields, methods, and sometimes local variables)
- Simple steps to get started making mods

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning
**Blueberry is a very small project.**
I try to keep the API compatibility between versions, but things could change at anytime!

## ‚ú® Key features
- Live Compiler (compiles the mod from .java files when loading a mod)
  - `Recompile` button on the mod list menu to recompile and reload the mod (see issues for known issues)
  - See the [documentation](https://www.blueberrymc.net/reference/source-mod/) for more details and how to use it properly
- [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin) support
- File selection screen within the client (FileDialogScreen)
- Bundled Kotlin (v1.7.0)
