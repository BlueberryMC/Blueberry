# Blueberry

Open-source modding API for Minecraft

## Why?
- Faster update (since it uses mojang mapping, no need to make our mapping)
- Deobfuscated code (classes, fields, methods)

## Important Warning
**Blueberry is a very small project.**
While I try to make this project bigger, there's literally almost no API for now.
It takes a long time to make this project bigger and get good APIs.

assets/blueberry/textures/gui/icons.png is from FML, obviously. (thanks FML, MinecraftForge team)

## Bugs
- Bug with resource manager? Texture goes nothing when mod resource pack is located at higher than default
- Builtin packs says "outdated"

## Todo
- Provide easy way to create profile or version in launcher for Blueberry
  - probably with bsdiff
- multiplayer support
