# Blueberry

Open-source modding API for Minecraft

## Why?
- Faster update (since it uses mojang mapping, no need to make our mapping)
- Deobfuscated code (classes, fields, methods)

## Important Warning
**Blueberry is a very small project.**
While I try to make this project bigger, there's literally almost no API for now.
It takes a long time to make this project bigger and get good APIs.

## Known Issues
- Synchronization issues with the server and client, with fluids probably.
  - Triggering block update causes nearby fluids to render normally

## Todo
- Provide easy way to create profile or version in launcher for Blueberry
  - probably with bsdiff
- multiplayer support
