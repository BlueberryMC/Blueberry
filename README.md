# Blueberry

Open-source modding API for Minecraft

## ü§î Why?
- Faster update (since it uses mojang mapping, no need to make our mapping)
  - it does not mean "fast update", because sometimes i don't have enough time to work on this project :(
- Deobfuscated code (classes, fields, methods)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning
**Blueberry is a very small project.**
Whilst I try not to break API compatibility, but things could change at anytime!

## ‚ú® Key features
- Live Compiler (Automatically compiles the mod from .java files)
  - Reload (You can recompile the mod in-game using "Recompile" button on the mod list menu, if the mod was compiled by live compiler... but buggy for now.)

## üìù Todo
- multiplayer support
  - "deny" incompatible clients, it just shows "incompatible" in client/server menu and users can connect
- write a ton of [docs](https://github.com/BlueberryMC/Blueberry-docs) and javadoc
- Migrate to gradle

## ‚úèÔ∏è Translations
All translation PRs are welcome!

To start the translation of the project, please follow these steps:
- Fork the project
- Clone the project with VSCode or anything you can browse files and edit them
- Go to `Blueberry-API/src/main/resources/assets/blueberry/lang`, create or modify the translation file! (Do not edit `en_us.json` unless they are misspelled)
- Create a PR with your changes.
